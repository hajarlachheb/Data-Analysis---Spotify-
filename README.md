# Data-Analysis-Spotify-


My project aims to analyze the results obtained and linked to the TOP 50 musical pieces on the SPOTIFY platform for the year 2019.
The choice of pieces and their classification is done by taking into account several criteria and this is what we would also take into account to carry out a more or less complete analysis of this dataset.
The entire dataset can be found on the official SPOTIFY website or on KAGGLE.
My Dataset then brings together 50 pieces with 13 variables each.
